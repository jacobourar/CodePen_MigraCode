  <p>
    It is highly possible you have heard about Guadalupe in your life, but not this Guadalupe. The Guadalupe you've probably heard of is in Mexico and is very famous for it's representative Virgin. </br> Although Colombian still very relegios in it's traditions and believes, the Guadalupe we are going to dive in today is a little town with no more than one thousand population, a little school and a very kind people.
  </p>
        <p>
    Guadalupe is located in Santander, one of the biggest departments (name which big regions receive in Colombia) In the north east of the country. This region is quite known for it's temperamental and hard working people, fertile land, meat and <em> big ass ants! </em> What? yes, In this region, these different species of ants are very much appreciated and also some people like to eat them.</br> However, Guadalupe is not that known, A lot of Colombian people don't know about it and clearly is a place that is worth it. </br> But wait, don't create a lot of expetations, Guadalupe still a little colonial town,<strong> it's magic resides in how quiet and calm is.</strong>
  </p>
      
       <p>
    To visit Guadalupe you will need to travel at least for six hours if you come from the Colombian capital, Bogot√°. When stepping out of the airport what you want is to take a taxi that takes you to the bus terminal. When arraving to the terminal, you will then look for a bus going to <strong>Oiba</strong>. This Bus will take 4/5 hours to arrive to Oiba and finally you will head to <strong>Guadalupe</strong> catching a bus that will tak one hour to arrive to the small town.</br> Sounds quite a trip huh! Well, is long but is highly enjoyable and full of beatiful landscapes. In addition to this it will just cost a few Euros, not more than 15 Euros.

<h2 id="places">Where to go in <span>Guadalupe</span>?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before Guagalupe is quite and very calm, if you want to get lost and live with no rush this will be the ideal place, however you still have a couple of things you can do. Mainly, the first place you will want to visit is Las <span>Las Gachas</span>. Las gachas is the most famous place to go in Guadalupe, it is a large ravine with natural jacuzzis of different sizes. The Second plan you would like to do is the typical horse ride down the valley heading the Suarez river, this ride is surreal and the final destination is a suspension bridge over the caudalous Suarez river.</p>
